Hey
  So, this is my lasted project combining React and the algorithms to visualize them. This is just a fun project to see how actually algorithms look visually. 
  This is the React Application and It visualize the different sorting Algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort etc. This is still in the development phase. But, developed enough to show
  
 You can download the code files and run the code using npm Command i.e.
 
 npm start
 
 I use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React for this project.
